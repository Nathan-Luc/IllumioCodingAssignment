# IllumioCodingAssignment

Linux Command-Line\
make main - compiles the code and provide a program output\
make run - runs the code\

a. How you tested your solution\
I ran my program and inputted a range of data and I had an expected result and then I compared that to the actual result. \
 
b. Any interesting coding, design, or algorithmic choices you’d like to point out \
I split up the code into three parts. One class for the prompt, another for the session, and then an URL class. \
This allows errors to be dectected quicker as all functionalities are broken up into different parts.

c. Any refinements or optimizations that you would’ve implemented if you had more time \
I would have liked to implemented something to prevent duplicates and display a message because currently I am using a set which will take in the value and insert the duplicate in the set but since sets do not allow duplicate it is just like a wasted instruction that is done. 

d. Anything else you’d like the reviewer to know \ 
I did not know what langauge that this needed to be done in so I did my strongest langauage which was C++. But I can learn to do this in other langauages if needed to. I also made a makefile for quick commands which I included the commands in the top portion of the README.
